## Magic Squares
This is Rubik's Square I guess, the text and the link are in the description!
Yea, I think this is the 3rd similar problem, but this time I got it
right. We have initial and final positions of the magic square, although I
didn't find any magic, most probably cos I'm very poor mathematician. In chess
for example when there is a problem find mate in 2 or smth we don't know the
final position, so it's one way search, here we can start from both ends in
different directions. First I've wrote the program in C++, than in Python, 
but in both programs there are lot of unnecessary things, and than started writing
it in C with moar clear mind what to do exactly, but has lost interest:)
